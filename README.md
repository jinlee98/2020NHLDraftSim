# 2020NHLDraftSim

Simulation of where each player will be selected in the 2020 NHL draft:

Takes 2020 NHL draft rankings from 5 different sources, pick one of the lists at random, and select the highest available player,
deleting them from any other lists. Repeat process until the first round is complete.

Sim the first round 'k' times, and log the data in csv files.

Use these files to construct a simple bar graph of which pick each player might be selected.
